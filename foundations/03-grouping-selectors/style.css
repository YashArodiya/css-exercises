 , (comma) is used to group different classes together -> basically, classes are different but their properties are same.
 when we attach them [ .one.two ] -> we are telling that there are a lot of classes and element having BOTH classes one and two 
     would be given these styling properties
 when you give space between two classes [ .one .two ] -> we are using dependence combinator, basically an inheritance of sort..
    all classes two which lie in class one would have these properties.
